ALX Interview: Lockboxes

Welcome to the Lockboxes project of the ALX Interview curriculum! In this project, you'll be tasked with developing a Python method to determine if all the locked boxes can be opened. Each box may contain keys to other boxes, and your goal is to determine if it's possible to unlock all the boxes starting from the first unlocked box.
Overview

The Lockboxes project challenges your Python programming skills and algorithmic thinking. By implementing a solution to this problem, you'll demonstrate your ability to work with lists, utilize various data structures like sets, and apply fundamental concepts such as recursion and graph traversal algorithms.
Concepts Needed

To successfully complete this project, you'll need knowledge and understanding of the following key concepts:

    Lists and List Manipulation
    Graph Theory Basics (Depth-First Search, Breadth-First Search)
    Algorithmic Complexity (Big O Notation)
    Recursion
    Queue and Stack
    Set Operations

Requirements

Ensure your solution meets the following requirements:

    Your Python files should be compatible with Python 3.4.3 and adhere to PEP 8 style guidelines.
    All files should start with #!/usr/bin/python3 and end with a new line.
    Document your code and provide clear explanations for your solution.
    Your code must be executable and thoroughly tested.
    Maintain a README.md file at the root of the project folder, providing instructions and explanations for running and understanding your solution.

Getting Started

To begin working on the Lockboxes project, follow these steps:

    Clone the GitHub repository: alx-interview
    Navigate to the 0x01-lockboxes directory.
    Review the provided main_0.py file to understand the expected input and output.
    Implement the canUnlockAll method in 0-lockboxes.py to solve the problem.
    Test your solution using the provided test cases and additional tests if needed.
    Document your code and provide explanations in the README.md file.

Support
