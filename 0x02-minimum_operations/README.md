#### Minimum Operations

This project focuses on devising an efficient algorithm to calculate the minimum number of operations needed to achieve a given number of characters in a text file using only "Copy All" and "Paste" operations. The problem statement involves starting with a text file containing a single character 'H' and performing operations to produce 'n' H characters.
Objective

The primary objective is to implement a method minOperations(n) that takes an integer 'n' as input and returns the fewest number of operations required to reach exactly 'n' H characters in the file. If achieving 'n' characters is impossible, the method returns 0.
Key Concepts

To effectively solve the problem, understanding the following concepts is essential:

    Dynamic Programming: Breaking down the problem into simpler subproblems and building up the solution using dynamic programming techniques.
    Prime Factorization: Utilizing prime factorization to reduce the problem to finding the sum of prime factors of the target number 'n'.
    Code Optimization: Optimizing the Python code to ensure efficiency in execution.
    Greedy Algorithms: Exploring greedy algorithms as an approach to selecting the best option at each step of the problem-solving process.
    Basic Python Programming: Proficiency in Python, including loops, conditionals, and functions, is necessary for implementation.
