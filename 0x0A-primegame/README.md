# Prime Game

## Description

The Prime Game is a competitive game where two players, Maria and Ben, take turns selecting prime numbers from a set of consecutive integers starting from 1 up to a given number \( n \). The selected prime number and all of its multiples are removed from the set. The player who cannot make a move loses the game. Maria always plays first, and both players play optimally.

This project involves determining the winner of multiple rounds of the game based on varying values of \( n \). The goal is to find out who wins the most rounds.
