Prime Game
Project Overview

The Prime Game is a strategic turn-based game played between two players, Maria and Ben. The game involves choosing prime numbers from a set of consecutive integers and removing those primes and their multiples from the set. The player who cannot make a move loses. Maria always goes first, and both players play optimally. The objective is to determine the winner of each game round and identify who won the most rounds.
Project Description

In this project, you will implement a Python function to determine the winner of a series of Prime Games. The game is played over multiple rounds, where each round starts with a different integer n and involves the following steps:

    Initialization: Start with consecutive integers from 1 to n.
    Gameplay:
        Maria and Ben take turns choosing a prime number from the set.
        The chosen prime and its multiples are removed from the set.
        The player who cannot make a move loses the round.
    Objective: Identify the player who wins the most rounds.
