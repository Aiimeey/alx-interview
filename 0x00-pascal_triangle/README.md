Pascal's Triangle

This project focuses on implementing Pascal's Triangle in Python. Pascal's Triangle is a mathematical concept that generates a triangular array of binomial coefficients. Each number in the triangle is the sum of the two directly above it. The triangle starts with a single 1 at the top and each subsequent row is constructed by adding adjacent elements in the row above.
Description

The objective of this project is to create a Python function pascal_triangle(n) that generates Pascal’s triangle up to the nth row. The function returns a list of lists of integers representing the triangle. If the input n is less than or equal to 0, an empty list is returned. The function assumes that n will always be an integer.
Prerequisites

    Memory Management
    Error and Exception Handling (Optional)
    Efficiency and Optimization

Tasks
Pascal's Triangle

    Function: Create a function pascal_triangle(n) that returns a list of lists of integers representing Pascal’s triangle of n:
        Returns an empty list if n <= 0
        Assumes n will be always an integer
